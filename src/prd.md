# Mission RepOSSible Rebranding PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: To help developers validate and ensure their GitHub repositories have all required files for open source compliance.
- **Success Indicators**: Increased adoption by developers, positive feedback on the rebranded user interface, and improved compliance rates.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, Trustworthy, User-friendly

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (validating repositories and fixing compliance issues)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: The application helps developers validate GitHub repositories for open source compliance, but needs a more professional, less playful branding.
- **User Context**: Developers and project managers will use this tool when preparing to open-source their projects.
- **Critical Path**: Repository URL input → validation → issue identification → issue resolution
- **Key Moments**: Initial validation, compliance check results, template generation

## Essential Features
- Repository validation (functionality remains unchanged)
- Visual rebranding for a more professional appearance
- Maintaining all existing functionality while updating the visual design
- Security features check (Secret scanning, Dependabot security updates, and CodeQL)

## Added Security Features
- **Secret Scanning**: Validates if GitHub's secret scanning is enabled for the repository
- **Dependabot Security Updates**: Checks if Dependabot security updates are enabled
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Verifies if CodeQL is enabled for code scanning
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual feedback on security feature status
- **Recommendations**: Actionable guidance for enabling missing security features

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, reliability, efficiency
- **Design Personality**: Professional, modern, refined, and technical
- **Visual Metaphors**: Code, compliance, verification
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, minimal interface with focused functionality

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Professional color palette with GitHub-inspired colors
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue (#0969da) - Represents trust and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: GitHub-inspired grayscale with accent highlights
- **Accent Color**: Verification green (#2da44e) for success states and positive actions
- **Color Psychology**: Blues for trust and professionalism, greens for success and completion
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds for readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Maintaining the existing Inter for body text with a more technical monospace font for headings
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and UI elements
- **Font Personality**: Technical, clean, modern
- **Which fonts**: Inter for body text, Jetbrains Mono for headings (maintaining existing fonts)

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Focus on validation results and actionable items
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous white space to enhance readability
- **Grid System**: Maintain responsive layout with improved spacing
- **Content Density**: Balanced information presentation with clear visual grouping

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Maintaining existing shadcn components with updated styling
- **Visual Consistency Framework**: Align with GitHub's design system for a more cohesive experience

## Implementation Considerations
- Update color scheme to a more professional palette
- Replace the spy/mission theme with a more professional GitHub-focused theme
- Maintain all existing functionality while updating visual elements
- Ensure accessibility is maintained or improved with new color choices
