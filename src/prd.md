# GitHub Repo Wizard PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Validate GitHub repository structures against standardized templates to ensure open source compliance and best practices.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can successfully validate repositories and identify missing required files, with actionable information on what needs to be added.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, Informative, Efficient

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (viewing validation results and recommendations)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Open source repositories often lack critical files needed for compliance, documentation, and community standards.
- **User Context**: Developers working on open source projects need to ensure their repos follow best practices before public release.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → Select validation template → View validation results → Add missing files
- **Key Moments**: Validation scan completion, viewing categorized results (required vs. recommended files)

## Essential Features
1. **GitHub Repository URL Input & Validation**
   - What it does: Accepts and validates GitHub repository URLs
   - Why it matters: Ensures users provide valid inputs before running validation
   - Success criteria: Prevents invalid URL submissions with helpful error messages

2. **Template Selection**
   - What it does: Allows users to choose from different validation templates (Basic, JavaScript, Python)
   - Why it matters: Different project types have different file requirements
   - Success criteria: Templates contain appropriate requirements for each project type

3. **Repository Structure Display**
   - What it does: Shows files and directories found in the repository
   - Why it matters: Provides visual context of the repo's current state
   - Success criteria: Accurately displays repo contents with visual differentiation between files and folders

4. **Validation Results Display**
   - What it does: Shows validation results, highlighting missing required and recommended files
   - Why it matters: Clearly indicates compliance status and improvement opportunities
   - Success criteria: Results are categorized by severity and provide clear information on each requirement

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, professionalism
- **Design Personality**: Professional with a clean, organized feel
- **Visual Metaphors**: Code structure, validation checklists
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface focusing on results and actionable information

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue (oklch(0.55 0.17 264)) for brand alignment and trust
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blue tints for supporting UI elements
- **Accent Color**: Success green (oklch(0.67 0.2 142)) for positive validation results
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and reliability, green indicates success/completion
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) on light backgrounds for readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and metadata
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, and highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Generous spacing, line heights, and careful sizing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font across the application with standardized size increments
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google font)
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at all sizes used in the application

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Card-based layout focuses attention on validation results
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to avoid overwhelming users with information
- **Grid System**: Two-column layout for larger screens, single column for mobile
- **Responsive Approach**: Flexible layout adapts to different screen sizes
- **Content Density**: Moderate density with scrollable areas for longer content

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Simple loading animation to indicate scanning in progress
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Minimal animations focused on state changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle animations that don't distract from information

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for content grouping, badges for status indicators
- **Component Customization**: Custom status badges with appropriate colors for different validation states
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and disabled states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub and file-related icons for visual context
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (Validate button) stand out visually
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable elements
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent colors, typography, and component styling
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card layouts, spacing, and typography
- **Brand Alignment**: GitHub-inspired color scheme and visual style

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: API rate limiting, private repositories, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages for API limitations and private repos
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations and response formatting

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Potential to add more template types and customizable requirements
- **Testing Focus**: API response handling, error states, and template accuracy
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle nested directories and complex repository structures?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely bridges the gap between technical requirements and user-friendly validation
- The focus on actionable results rather than just reporting problems sets this tool apart
- Adding template file content previews would make this solution truly exceptional
