# GitHub Repo Wizard - PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Validate GitHub repositories to ensure they include all required standard files for open source best practices.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can quickly verify if their repos contain all necessary standard files and understand what's missing.
- **Experience Qualities**: Efficient, Helpful, Clear

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming - users primarily consume validation information about their repositories

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Open source projects and repositories often miss important files that are considered standard for well-maintained projects.
- **User Context**: Developers will use this when setting up new repositories or auditing existing ones for compliance with best practices.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → Select validation template → Review results → Address missing files
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Validation completion showing missing required files
  2. Clear distinction between required vs. recommended files

## Essential Features
1. **Repository URL Validation**
   - Accepts and validates GitHub repository URLs
   - Provides clear error messages for invalid URLs
   - Success criteria: Successfully identifies and rejects malformed URLs

2. **Repository Content Scanning**
   - Fetches repository file structure from GitHub API
   - Builds list of existing files for comparison
   - Success criteria: Accurately retrieves repo file structure

3. **File Requirements Checking**
   - Compares existing files against required file templates
   - Categorizes findings as present, missing required, or missing recommended
   - Success criteria: Correctly identifies presence/absence of all required files

4. **Validation Templates**
   - Offers different validation templates for various project types
   - Includes general repository requirements like README, LICENSE, etc.
   - Success criteria: Templates cover common project types and standard requirements

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, and competence
- **Design Personality**: Professional with GitHub-inspired aesthetic
- **Visual Metaphors**: File structure, checks/validation concepts
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with clear focus on validation results

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: GitHub-inspired with complementary accent colors
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue for primary actions and branding
- **Secondary Colors**: Subtle blue tints for secondary elements
- **Accent Color**: Success green for validation passes, warning amber for recommendations, error red for failures
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and professionalism, green indicates success, amber suggests caution, red signals important issues
- **Color Accessibility**: All color pairings maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds for maximum readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varying weights for different hierarchical levels
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, labels, and body text through weight and size
- **Font Personality**: Clean, professional, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Generous spacing and line heights for comfortable reading
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent text sizing and weights throughout the application
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Font)
- **Legibility Check**: High legibility with clean sans-serif font, appropriately sized

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Primary focus on repository URL input followed by validation results
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between sections to create clear separation
- **Grid System**: Responsive grid with single column on mobile, dual column results on larger screens
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with appropriate stacking and resizing
- **Content Density**: Balanced - providing comprehensive information without overwhelming the user

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations for loading states
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading indicator during API calls
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animations to maintain professional feel

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for main input and results sections, badges for status indicators
- **Component Customization**: GitHub-inspired styling with shadcn components
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for input validation and form submission
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub logo, file/folder icons, and status indicators
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary validation form, secondary results display
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout with full-width components on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design using shadcn UI library
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, and component styling
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card patterns and spacing
- **Brand Alignment**: Subtle GitHub-inspired aesthetic

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Private repositories, API rate limiting, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages for API failures
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for additional validation templates and file requirements
- **Testing Focus**: Different repository structures and error conditions
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle nested files and directories for validation

## Reflection
- The approach focuses on simplicity and clarity, making repository validation accessible to developers of all experience levels.
- We've assumed users want quick validation rather than deep analysis, which shapes our focused UI.
- The application could be exceptional by providing suggested file content templates for missing files.
