# GitHub Open Source Release Checklist - PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A tool that validates GitHub repositories for open source readiness by checking for required files and offering template-based solutions.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can validate repositories, identify missing required files, and easily add them from templates.
- **Experience Qualities**: Helpful, empowering, educational.

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (validating repositories and adding missing files)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Open source repositories need certain files to be complete and compliant, but developers often miss them.
- **User Context**: Developers preparing to release or maintain open source projects need a quick way to validate completeness.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → validate presence of required files → view results → fix missing files with templates.
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Repository validation results display
  2. One-click template selection for missing files

## Essential Features
1. **Repository URL Validation**
   - What: Parse and validate GitHub repository URLs
   - Why: Ensure proper access to the target repository
   - Success: Correctly extracts owner/repo and displays appropriate error messages

2. **File Existence Checker**
   - What: Check for required files like README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.
   - Why: These files are essential for proper open source projects
   - Success: Accurately identifies present and missing files

3. **Template-Based File Creation**
   - What: Offer template options for missing files
   - Why: Help users quickly fix compliance issues
   - Success: Users can easily select and apply appropriate templates

4. **Dependency Analysis**
   - What: Analyze repository dependencies and licenses
   - Why: Identify potential licensing conflicts
   - Success: Accurate reporting of licenses and flagging of potential concerns

5. **Theme Toggle**
   - What: Switch between light and dark mode
   - Why: Enhance user experience across different environments
   - Success: Seamless theme switching with persistent preferences

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, empowerment, trust
- **Design Personality**: Professional with playful accents - serious functionality with GitHub-themed whimsy
- **Visual Metaphors**: Mission briefing, checklist completion, spy/agent theme (Mission RepOSSible)
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, focused interface with playful thematic elements

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Brand-aligned with GitHub colors plus mission theme accents
- **Primary Color**: GitHub purple (#6F42C1) - represents the GitHub brand and innovation
- **Secondary Colors**: Dark blues and blacks for a "mission control" feel
- **Accent Color**: Success green for completed items, warning amber for items needing attention
- **Color Psychology**: Purple conveys creativity and quality, green indicates success and completion
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: High contrast text/background combinations for readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: JetBrains Mono for headings (technical, precise) and Inter for body text (clean, readable)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and content text
- **Font Personality**: Technical, precise, modern
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height and spacing for comfortable reading
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing across similar elements
- **Which fonts**: JetBrains Mono, Inter
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts highly legible across sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Mission status/results as focal point
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between sections for clear separation
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout for distinct feature sections
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack cards vertically on smaller screens
- **Content Density**: Moderate density with expandable sections for detailed information

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations convey state changes and guide attention
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Status changes animate most prominently
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Mission-themed animations enhance the experience without distraction

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for major sections, alerts for warnings, badges for status indicators
- **Component Customization**: Mission-themed styling for cards and buttons
- **Component States**: Clear hover/active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub and Phosphor icons for consistent visual language
- **Component Hierarchy**: Repository input as primary, results as secondary, actions as tertiary
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Full-width cards and stacked layout on mobile

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with thematic styling
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card styling and spacing
- **Brand Alignment**: GitHub octocat theme with mission elements

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Rate limiting, private repositories, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative messages
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations, repository size constraints

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for checking additional file types
- **Testing Focus**: Repository URL parsing, file existence detection
- **Critical Questions**: How to best handle template suggestions for different project types

## Reflection
- The spy/mission theme adds a playful layer to what could otherwise be a purely utilitarian tool
- The focus on helpful guidance rather than just validation makes this uniquely valuable
- Exceptional execution would include intelligent suggestions based on repository context
