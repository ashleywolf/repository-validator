# GitHub Repo Wizard - Planning Guide

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Help developers ensure their GitHub repositories follow open source best practices by checking for required files and offering templates.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can identify missing files and add standardized templates to their repositories with minimal effort.
- **Experience Qualities**: Efficient, helpful, intuitive

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (validating repos and generating template files)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Open source repositories often miss critical documentation files, making them less usable and compliant.
- **User Context**: Developers preparing to publish projects or improving existing repositories.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → Validate files → Generate missing templates → Copy to clipboard or download
- **Key Moments**: Repo validation results, template generation with customization options

## Essential Features
1. **Repo Validation**
   - Checks GitHub repositories for essential files
   - Helps users identify what's missing
   - Success: Accurately reports missing required files

2. **Template Generation**
   - Provides standardized templates for missing files
   - Allows customization of template content
   - Success: Users can easily copy/download templated content

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, efficiency, helpfulness
- **Design Personality**: Professional, clean, developer-focused
- **Visual Metaphors**: Document templates, checklists, validation
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with clear workflow

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: GitHub-inspired color palette with purposeful accents
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue for branding and primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft blues for secondary elements
- **Accent Color**: Success green for validation passes, warning amber, error red
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and professionalism, green indicates success
- **Color Accessibility**: All color pairings meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text (foreground) on light backgrounds for optimal readability

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headings, medium weight for important text, regular for body
- **Font Personality**: Clean, professional, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Appropriate spacing, line heights, and font sizes
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and weight usage throughout
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Font)
- **Legibility Check**: High legibility with clean sans-serif design

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Clear workflow from top to bottom
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create clear separation between sections
- **Grid System**: Simple card-based layout with responsive grid
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack cards vertically on mobile, side by side on larger screens
- **Content Density**: Moderate density with focus on clarity

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations for state changes only
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading indicators, validation status changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animation to maintain focus on task

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for main sections, alerts for notifications, badges for status
- **Component Customization**: GitHub-inspired styling with shadcn components
- **Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub logo, file icons, validation status icons
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary action buttons, secondary text links
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Full-width inputs and buttons on small screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with shadcn UI
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, component usage
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card structures and spacing
- **Brand Alignment**: GitHub-inspired design language

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: API rate limiting, private repositories, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages for API failures
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for additional file templates and customization options
- **Testing Focus**: Validate template generation across different file types
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle customization needs for different organizations?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely addresses the gap between validation and remediation by providing both checks and solutions.
- The assumption that standardized templates will meet most needs should be validated with user feedback.
- Adding template customization capabilities would make this solution truly exceptional.
