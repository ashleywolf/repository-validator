# GitHub OSS Repository Validator - PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: A tool to validate GitHub repositories for open source readiness by checking for required files, dependencies, and potential issues.
- **Success Indicators**: Complete repository validation with actionable feedback on missing files and potential compliance issues.
- **Experience Qualities**: Efficient, Informative, Helpful

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (repository validation with basic state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (receiving validation feedback on repository compliance)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Developers need to ensure their repositories have all required files and meet compliance standards before open-sourcing.
- **User Context**: Engineers and compliance teams preparing GitHub repositories for public release.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repository URL → Validate repository → View validation results → Fix issues
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Seeing the comprehensive validation report
  2. Easily identifying missing required files
  3. Understanding dependency license implications

## Essential Features
1. **Repository Validation**
   - Checks for required files (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
   - Verifies GitHub copyright in LICENSE files
   - Success criteria: Properly identifies missing files and provides clear feedback

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Parses SBOM data to count dependencies by license type
   - Flags GPL/AGPL licenses that require additional review
   - Success criteria: Accurately identifies license types and presents clear warnings

3. **Description Rating**
   - Analyzes repository description quality
   - Provides feedback on improving descriptions
   - Success criteria: Meaningful feedback on description quality

4. **Security & Compliance Checks**
   - Checks for security features like secret scanning and CodeQL
   - Scans for telemetry files and internal references
   - Success criteria: Comprehensive detection of compliance issues

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Trust, Professionalism, Helpfulness
- **Design Personality**: Professional with GitHub-inspired aesthetics
- **Visual Metaphors**: Security badges, checkmarks, status indicators
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, focused interface with progressive disclosure of detailed analysis

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: GitHub-inspired palette
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue (#0969da) for primary actions and branding
- **Secondary Colors**: GitHub green (#2da44e) for success states
- **Accent Color**: GitHub red (#cf222e) for warnings and errors
- **Color Psychology**: Blue inspires trust and reliability, green signifies success, red highlights important warnings
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Dark text on light backgrounds for readability, white text on colored action buttons

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: JetBrains Mono for headings and Inter for body text
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between section titles, item labels, and status messages
- **Font Personality**: Technical, readable, clean
- **Readability Focus**: Appropriate line heights and spacing for scanning complex validation results
- **Which fonts**: JetBrains Mono and Inter from Google Fonts

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Card-based layout focusing on validation results
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between sections for visual separation
- **Grid System**: Responsive grid adapting to different screen sizes
- **Content Density**: Compact enough to show comprehensive validation but with enough space to be readable

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for result sections, badges for status indicators, alerts for errors
- **Component Customization**: GitHub-themed styling for components
- **Component States**: Clear visual indication of success, warning, and error states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clear visual communication
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding and margins based on Tailwind's spacing scale

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance with clear color differentiation for status indicators

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for analyzing larger repositories without hitting rate limits
- **Testing Focus**: Validate functionality with various repository types and structures
- **Critical Questions**: How to effectively handle GitHub API rate limits for unauthenticated users

## Reflection
- The approach is uniquely suited to GitHub's ecosystem, following its design patterns and API structures
- The tool provides immediate, actionable feedback in a familiar GitHub-inspired interface
- Exceptional features include comprehensive analysis beyond just checking for files, including security settings and code analysis
