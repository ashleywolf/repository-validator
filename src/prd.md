# GitHub Repo Wizard PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Help developers quickly validate GitHub repositories for required files and structure.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can successfully validate repos, view missing files, and get actionable feedback on repo compliance.
- **Experience Qualities**: Efficient, Intuitive, Informative

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting - validating repo structure and receiving guidance

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Developers need to ensure their repos contain required files before submission, but manual checking is tedious and error-prone.
- **User Context**: Users will engage when preparing to submit/share repositories, during code reviews, or when establishing new projects.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → Fetch repo contents → Validate against requirements → Display results with actionable insights
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Validating a URL and seeing real-time feedback
  2. Viewing a comprehensive analysis of the repo structure
  3. Receiving specific guidance on missing requirements

## Essential Features
1. **GitHub URL Input & Validation**
   - What: Form input that accepts and validates GitHub repository URLs
   - Why: Ensures users provide a correct entry point for analysis
   - Success: Users receive immediate feedback on URL validity

2. **Repository File Scanner**
   - What: Fetches and analyzes repository file structure
   - Why: Provides the core data needed for validation
   - Success: Can correctly fetch and parse files from public repositories

3. **Requirements Definition**
   - What: Interface to define which files/patterns should be required
   - Why: Allows customization to different project standards
   - Success: Users can select from common presets or define custom requirements

4. **Results Display**
   - What: Clear visual feedback on compliance status
   - Why: Helps users quickly identify issues to address
   - Success: Users can instantly understand which requirements are met/unmet

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, reassurance
- **Design Personality**: Professional, efficient, modern
- **Visual Metaphors**: Checklist, verification badges, organized files
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface to focus on the validation results

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#0969DA) - represents reliability and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Lighter blues for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Green for success (#238636), amber for warnings (#F2A60C), red for errors (#E5534B)
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and reliability; strategic accent colors provide clear status indicators
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations exceed WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (#FFFFFF) / Foreground (#0C0E12)
  - Card (#F6F8FA) / Card-Foreground (#0C0E12)
  - Primary (#0969DA) / Primary-Foreground (#FFFFFF)
  - Secondary (#EBF5FF) / Secondary-Foreground (#0969DA)
  - Accent (#238636) / Accent-Foreground (#FFFFFF)
  - Muted (#F6F8FA) / Muted-Foreground (#57606A)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single sans-serif font family with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings (600 weight) and body text (400 weight)
- **Font Personality**: Clean, modern, technical but approachable
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height (1.5) and appropriate text sizes (16px base)
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing and sizing ratios throughout
- **Which fonts**: Inter - a clean, highly-readable sans-serif that works well for both UI and longer text
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at all sizes and provides excellent clarity for technical information

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Focus on input area initially, then clear transition to results
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to separate distinct functional areas
- **Grid System**: Simple single-column layout on mobile, expanding to two columns on larger screens
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack elements vertically on small screens, side-by-side on larger screens
- **Content Density**: Moderate - balancing comprehensive information with clarity

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations to indicate scanning progress and results appearance
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary animation for validation process, secondary for UI feedback
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Restrained animations focused on functional feedback rather than decoration

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for results, alerts for notifications, progress indicators for scanning
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners and subtle shadows for cards and interactive elements
- **Component States**: Clear hover/focus states for interactive elements with color and subtle scale changes
- **Icon Selection**: Using repository, file, check/x-mark, and warning icons to represent different statuses
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary action (validate button), secondary actions (configuration options)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4-point grid (0.25rem base) for all spacing values
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Full-width components on mobile, with appropriate touch targets

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based for maximum reusability
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography, spacing, component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card styling and spacing throughout the interface
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance aligned with developer tools

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Private repositories, rate limiting, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages for unauthorized access or rate limits
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations, browser security restrictions

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for different repository hosts in the future
- **Testing Focus**: Validate correct detection across different repository structures
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle very large repositories or complex nested structures?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines simplicity with actionable insights, focusing on quick, useful feedback.
- We've assumed users primarily need validation against common standards rather than deep analysis.
- To make this exceptional, we could add intelligent suggestions for fixing issues and templates for missing files.
