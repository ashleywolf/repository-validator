# Mission RepOSSible - GitHub Open Source Release Checklist

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Validate GitHub repositories against compliance standards to ensure they're ready for open source release.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can successfully validate repositories, identify missing required files, and take action to improve compliance.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, Actionable, Engaging

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (viewing validation results) and Acting (adding missing files)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Open source repositories need proper governance files to be compliant and community-friendly.
- **User Context**: Developers preparing to open source a project or improve an existing one need to verify all required files are in place.
- **Critical Path**: Enter repo URL → Authenticate if needed → View validation results → Add missing files
- **Key Moments**: Scanning repository for files, viewing compliance summary, adding required files via templates

## Essential Features
1. **GitHub Repository Validation**

3. **File Compliance Checking**
   - What it does: Checks for required open source files (README, LICENSE, etc.)
   - Why it matters: Ensures repositories follow open source best practices
   - Success criteria: Comprehensive validation with clear success/failure indicators

4. **Repository Description Analysis**
   - What it does: Evaluates the quality of repository descriptions
   - Why it matters: Good descriptions improve project discoverability and adoption
   - Success criteria: Accurate ratings with actionable improvement feedback

5. **License Analysis**
   - What it does: Verifies proper licensing information
   - Why it matters: Ensures legal compliance for open source projects
   - Success criteria: Correctly identifies copyright holders and license types

6. **Dependency License Analysis**
   - What it does: Analyzes project dependencies for license compatibility and provides SBOM export
   - Why it matters: Prevents unexpected licensing issues from dependencies and enables compliance documentation
   - Success criteria: Highlights potential license conflicts requiring review and offers exportable data

7. **Template-Based File Creation**
   - What it does: Provides templates for required files
   - Why it matters: Simplifies adding missing files with proper content
   - Success criteria: Easy to use templates that can be directly added to repositories

8. **Internal References Check**
   - What it does: Scans repository for internal references, confidential information, and trademarks
   - Why it matters: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive or internal information
   - Success criteria: Identifies potential issues requiring review before open-sourcing

9. **Repository History Management**
   - What it does: Provides guidance on squashing repository history before open-sourcing
   - Why it matters: Ensures sensitive information in commit history is removed
   - Success criteria: Clear instructions for safely squashing repository history

10. **Theme Toggle**
    - What it does: Allows users to switch between dark and light themes
    - Why it matters: Improves accessibility and user comfort in different environments
    - Success criteria: Seamless theme switching that persists across sessions

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, excitement, accomplishment
- **Design Personality**: Spy/Mission theme with technical precision
- **Visual Metaphors**: Mission briefcase, code verification, security clearance
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Focused interface with mission-critical information

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Dual theme (dark/light) with purple accents as brand color
- **Primary Color**: Rich purple (oklch(0.65 0.2 264)) representing the mission theme
- **Secondary Colors**: Dark/light backgrounds based on theme selection
- **Accent Color**: Bright green for success indicators
- **Color Psychology**: Dark theme creates focus, light theme improves readability in bright environments
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between text and backgrounds for readability in both themes
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: Light text on dark backgrounds (dark theme), dark text on light backgrounds (light theme)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: JetBrains Mono for headings (technical, precise) and Inter for body text (clean, readable)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and UI elements
- **Font Personality**: Technical, modern, clean
- **Readability Focus**: High contrast, appropriate sizes, and careful spacing
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of weights and sizes across the application
- **Which fonts**: JetBrains Mono and Inter (Google fonts)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts highly legible in dark mode with light text

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Mission-critical information highlighted with color and position
- **White Space Philosophy**: Focused spacing to create clear sections without overwhelming
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout for distinct information grouping
- **Responsive Approach**: Maintains usability across device sizes
- **Content Density**: Moderate density with scrollable areas for detailed information

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations that reinforce the mission theme
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Movement focused on state changes and important interactions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Mission-themed cards, badges, and buttons
- **Component Customization**: Custom spy/mission themed decorative elements
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for all interactive states
- **Icon Selection**: Technical and mission-related icons
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions clearly distinguished
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing throughout
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout on smaller screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent mission theme
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent colors, typography, and component styling
- **Visual Rhythm**: Repeated patterns and consistent layout structure
- **Brand Alignment**: GitHub-inspired with mission theme overlay

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: API rate limiting, private repositories, SSO/SAML-protected repositories, large repositories
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear error messages with guided authentication options for each repository type
- **Technical Constraints**: GitHub API limitations, authentication complexities for different repository types, dependency analysis complexity

## Implementation Considerations
